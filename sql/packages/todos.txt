should we check for dup_value_on_index when inserting?: no who ever called the procedure should know that they made a mistake
should we check for sql%notfound when select into?: no, sql automatically throws an error when you select into and finds nothing
way to check if insert fails? do we need to?: no need to check if an insert fails. SQL throws an error for us. Whoever called the procedure should handle that error
