 - Fix the compilation pane
 - when switching panes the database objects should be deleted from the cache
 - clicking a recording should show the recording contributors
 - add a logs pane (show only)
 - show collection sets
 - filter by released and unreleased compilation/recordings (using the boolean)
 - use the getDurationString instead of getDuration for compilations and recordings
 - set the window to not resizable
 - center the popups
 - make it look pretty

### Problems
- the program crashes when the vpn is not set
